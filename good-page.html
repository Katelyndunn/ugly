      As you can see this website is quite hideous and making this cat upset. This is due to multiple factors. The first being font type. Fonts are important for making impressions. Choosimg the right font can make all the difference for your wesite. Comic Sans can be apealing because of its fun childlike impression. Professional websites however ARE NOT MADE BY OR FOR CHILDREN.

          You also may have noticed the animations of the title and headng. ALthough fun and playful, no respected website would include these. These types of animations are distracting. Go ahead and click on them above to fix it.

        Color is very important as well. The yellow is very hard to read and not pleasant at all. Colors should compliment each other not give you a headache. Patterns and colors should be subtle to keep focus on the content.
